## Blazor App And Command pattern
This repository demonstrates a Blazor application implementing the Command Pattern. The Command Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that turns a request into a stand-alone object that contains all information about the request. This transformation lets you parameterize methods with different requests, delay or queue a request's execution, and support undoable operations.

## Features
Blazor Integration: Leverages the Blazor framework for building interactive web UIs using C#.
Command Pattern Implementation: Demonstrates how to use the Command Pattern to encapsulate requests as objects, allowing for more flexible and maintainable code.
Modular Design: Encourages separation of concerns, making the application easier to extend and maintain.
